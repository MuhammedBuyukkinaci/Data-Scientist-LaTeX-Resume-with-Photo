# Pricing

This project is open-source & free. If you have no experience about coding and liked this template, I can make a resume in this type for some amount of money. If you prefer this, just leave a comment in _Issues_.

# Installation

I highly recommend using [overleaf](https://overleaf.com) to compile the code. It requires a sign up. You should choose LuaLateX to compile the code.
